Program Name: Russian Peasant System Simulator
Assignment Name: Russian Peasant System Summative
Course Code: ICS3U1-22

Author: Ryan Tan

Program Description: This program uses the Russian Peasant System to find 
the product of two integers which values are inputted using a scanner. 
Depending on these values, the program may decide to not use the peasant 
system as there might be no need. In the case of zero values, any number 
times zero is zero. In the case of negative values, they arenâ€™t accepted 
in the Russian Peasant System. Finally, when a user enters two zeros, the 
program is set to end instead of looping and asking the user for more 
values as it usually would.

Assumptions and limitations:
- Expect that the user can read
- Expect that the user can type
- Expect that the user enters valid input (integers)
